# Halo
A program for editing `.wgsl` shaders, written in [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced).

Halo is currently in very early WIP. Basic functionality is complete, e.g. you can edit shaders and immediately see the 
results, but it is missing a lot of QOL features.

Big thanks to [relrelb](https://github.com/relrelb) for the [WGSL Sublime SyntaxSet](https://github.

### Easy
